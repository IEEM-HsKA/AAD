# AAD
Automotive Attack Database (AAD)


The Excel sheets "Automotive_SecurityAttack_Classification.ods" and "Automotive_SecurityAttack_Classification_Splitted.ods" are data sets which belong to our publication "Survey and Classification of Automotive Security Attacks" (https://doi.org/10.3390/info10040148). The first file contains 162 security attacks on vehicles. In the second file these attacks are splitted into their individual steps (412 steps).

Automotive_Attack_Database_(AAD)_V2.0.db is an update of these two data sets in an SQLite table. The table contains 361 security attacks (621 attack steps) from public sources.
